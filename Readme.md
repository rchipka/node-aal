# node-aal

Node AAL (accessibility abstraction layer) provides cross-platform bindings for
the OS's native accessibility API, which allows interaction with various on-screen
UI elements (windows, menus, etc).

This library uses the cross-platform [AAL](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-workbench/tree/8.0/tools/mga/src/aal)
code written for "MySQL GUI Automator" ([MGA](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-workbench/tree/8.0/tools/mga)),
which is used for the [MySQL Workbench](https://github.com/mysql/mysql-workbench) project.
